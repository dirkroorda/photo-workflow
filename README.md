Synchronize a set of photos with Flickr.

[Usage ...](docs.usage.md)

## Example

[historisch-eefde](https://github.com/dirkroorda/historisch-eefde)
is a set of historical photos of a particular village in the Netherlands.
The times and places are not always clear, and ongoing research may lead to
various updates.

The set is maintained on a local computer and published on Flickr.
So we need to be able to apply metadata updates to Flickr as a matter of routine.

This includes album organization on the basis of keywords.

The `updatr` tool has been written for this use case.
